Hey There! My name is William and I am a 4th Year student at the University of British Columbia studying Computer Science and Business. My current interests are full stack development, project management, tech consulting, and keyboard building. 

I'm always keen to learn new things and try new experiences and I think tech is the perfect space for that. I've always loved tech due to the innovation and change it has sparked in the world. As a result, I strive to create to work in tech to contribute to the change I want to see.
